# project title: face_recognation
Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming the identity of an individual using an image of their face.


# Prerequisites: 
Python 3.x (Recommended: Python 3.7+)
PIP (Python Package Installer)


# Required Libraries:

1) sklearn.datasets : Sklearn provides a wide range of functions for generating datasets, including functions for classification, regression, clustering, and more, which makes it a flexible tool for generating test datasets for different types of machine learning tasks
2) fetch_lfw_people:
3) pandas: Pandas is used to analyze data.
4) face_recognition: A wrapper for dlib to make face recognition simpler.
5) numpy: For numerical operations
6) Matplotlib:Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.


# Usage:

1) Run the Jupyter Notebook
2) jupyter notebook face_recognation.ipynb
3) Follow the steps in the notebook to:
4) Load face datasets
5) Train the recognition model
6) Test real-time face recognition



# Dataset

Ensure you have a dataset of images with labeled faces. The dataset should be organized in separate folders per individual:

                        /dataset/
                           /person1/
                               img1.jpg
                               img2.jpg
                           /person2/
                               img1.jpg
                               img2.jpg
